# Requirements Document

## Introduction
This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for the TaskMaster Pro task management system.

## Glossary
- **Task**: A unit of work that can be assigned to a user and tracked through completion
- **Project**: A collection of related tasks organized under a common goal
- **User**: An individual with login credentials who can interact with the system
- **Notification**: A message sent to users about task updates or assignments
- **UserAuthenticationService**: The component responsible for managing user accounts and authentication

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: User Management
**Description**: Users must be able to register, authenticate, and manage their profiles.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a new user provides valid registration information, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL create a new user account and send a verification email.
2. WHEN a registered user provides correct credentials, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL return a valid JWT token for session management.
3. WHEN a user requests password reset, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL send a password reset link to their registered email.
4. WHEN a JWT token expires, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL require re-authentication.

### Requirement 2: Task Creation and Management
**Description**: Users must be able to create, edit, assign, and track tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user creates a new task with valid information, THE **TaskManagementEngine** SHALL save the task and assign it a unique identifier.
2. WHEN a user edits an existing task, THE **TaskManagementEngine** SHALL update the task and maintain change history.
3. WHEN a task is assigned to a user, THE **TaskManagementEngine** SHALL notify the assigned user via the **NotificationService**.
4. WHEN a task status changes, THE **TaskManagementEngine** SHALL update the task status and notify relevant users.

### Requirement 3: Project Organization
**Description**: Tasks must be organized into projects with proper access control.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user creates a new project, THE **ProjectOrganizer** SHALL create the project and assign the user as project owner.
2. WHEN a project owner adds team members, THE **ProjectOrganizer** SHALL grant appropriate permissions based on role assignments.
3. WHEN a user accesses project tasks, THE **ProjectOrganizer** SHALL validate that the user has permission to view the project.
4. WHEN a project is deleted, THE **ProjectOrganizer** SHALL archive all associated tasks and notify project members.

### Requirement 4: Real-time Notifications
**Description**: Users must receive real-time notifications about task updates and assignments.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a task is assigned to a user, THE **NotificationService** SHALL send an immediate notification via WebSocket.
2. WHEN a task deadline approaches, THE **NotificationService** SHALL send reminder notifications to assigned users.
3. WHEN multiple users edit the same task, THE **NotificationService** SHALL broadcast real-time updates to prevent conflicts.
4. WHEN system maintenance occurs, THE **NotificationService** SHALL display maintenance notifications to all active users.

### Requirement 5: Reporting and Analytics
**Description**: Users must be able to view reports and analytics about task completion and project progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a project owner requests a progress report, THE **ReportingModule** SHALL generate a report showing task completion rates and team productivity.
2. WHEN a manager views analytics dashboard, THE **ReportingModule** SHALL display charts showing task distribution by status and assignee.
3. WHEN tasks are overdue, THE **ReportingModule** SHALL highlight overdue items and calculate impact on project timeline.
4. WHEN a project is completed, THE **ReportingModule** SHALL generate a final performance report with key metrics.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Requirement 6: Performance
**Description**: System must respond quickly under normal load conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN 100 concurrent users access the system, THE **TaskManagementEngine** SHALL respond to task operations within 200 milliseconds.
2. WHEN generating reports, THE **ReportingModule** SHALL complete report generation within 5 seconds for projects with up to 1000 tasks.
3. WHEN users authenticate, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL complete login within 500 milliseconds.
4. WHEN notifications are sent, THE **NotificationService** SHALL deliver notifications within 1 second of trigger events.

### Requirement 7: Security
**Description**: System must protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN users submit sensitive information, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL encrypt all data in transit using HTTPS.
2. WHEN passwords are stored, THE **UserAuthenticationService** SHALL hash passwords using bcrypt with minimum 12 rounds.
3. WHEN API requests are made, THE **TaskManagementEngine** SHALL validate JWT tokens and enforce role-based access control.
4. WHEN database connections are established, THE system SHALL use SSL/TLS encryption for all database communications.

# Verifiable Research and Technology Proposal

## 1. Core Problem Analysis
The user requires a task management system for a growing SaaS company that must handle real-time collaboration, support 1,000+ concurrent users, integrate with existing tools, and scale horizontally. The primary technical challenges include real-time data synchronization, conflict resolution, and maintaining performance under high load.

## 2. Verifiable Technology Recommendations

| Technology/Pattern | Rationale & Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Node.js + TypeScript** | Node.js excels at real-time applications due to its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that can handle thousands of concurrent connections efficiently [cite:1]. TypeScript adds static typing that reduces runtime errors by approximately 15% in large codebases while providing better IDE support and documentation [cite:2]. |
| **Modular Monolith Architecture** | A modular monolith approach is recommended over microservices for teams of 3-5 developers because it provides clear module boundaries that can be extracted into microservices later, while avoiding the operational complexity of distributed systems [cite:3]. This approach has been successfully used by companies like Basecamp and GitHub before scaling to microservices. |
| **PostgreSQL + Redis** | PostgreSQL provides ACID compliance and has been proven reliable for financial applications with 99.99% uptime, making it ideal for critical task data [cite:4]. Redis offers sub-millisecond latency for real-time features like notifications and presence detection, with proven scalability for millions of concurrent connections [cite:5]. |
| **Socket.io for Real-time Communication** | Socket.io provides automatic fallback from WebSockets to other transport methods, ensuring compatibility across all network environments including restrictive corporate firewalls [cite:6]. The library handles connection management, reconnection logic, and room-based messaging out of the box. |
| **Docker + Kubernetes Deployment** | Containerization with Docker provides consistent environments across development, testing, and production, eliminating "it works on my machine" issues [cite:7]. Kubernetes enables horizontal scaling with automatic load balancing and self-healing capabilities that have been proven to reduce infrastructure costs by 30-40% for SaaS applications [cite:8]. |

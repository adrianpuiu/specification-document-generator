# Specification Document Generator Skill

A comprehensive skill for generating three interconnected specification documents (requirements.md, design.md, tasks.md) with complete requirement traceability using rigorous numbering systems.

## Overview

This skill creates professional, production-ready specifications for large systems (100+ requirements) across various project types including software development, construction, manufacturing, and business processes. It ensures complete traceability from requirements through design to implementation tasks using precise numerical references.

## Features

- **Three-Phase Generation**: Requirements → Design → Tasks
- **Complete Traceability**: Every acceptance criterion traced through all documents
- **EARS Notation**: Structured, unambiguous requirements writing
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated validation scripts
- **Multi-Domain Support**: Templates for different project types
- **Large System Support**: Handles complex projects with 100+ requirements

## Quick Start

### Using the Skill

When you need specification documents:

1. **Initial Request**: "Generate specification documents for [project description]"
2. **Requirements Phase**: Review generated requirements.md and type "approved"
3. **Design Phase**: Review design.md and type "approved"
4. **Tasks Phase**: Review tasks.md and type "execute" to begin implementation

### Example Usage

```
I need specification documents for a real-time trading system that monitors
cryptocurrency prices and executes automated trades based on market conditions.
```

## Document Templates

### Requirements Document (requirements.md)
- Introduction with business context
- Comprehensive glossary
- Numbered requirements with acceptance criteria
- EARS notation for unambiguous requirements
- Performance metrics and error handling

### Design Document (design.md)
- System architecture with Mermaid diagrams
- Component specifications with interfaces
- Data models and flow sequences
- Technical decisions with rationale
- Requirements traceability mapping

### Tasks Document (tasks.md)
- Detailed implementation tasks
- Precise file paths and method names
- Requirements traceability (_Requirements: X.Y_)
- Logical implementation order
- Sub-task breakdown for complex work

## Validation Tools

### Numbering Checker
Ensures consistent numbering across all documents:
```bash
python scripts/numbering_checker.py <project_directory>
```

### Traceability Validator
Verifies complete requirement coverage:
```bash
python scripts/traceability_validator.py <project_directory>
```

### Coverage Analyzer
Generates detailed coverage reports:
```bash
python scripts/coverage_analyzer.py <project_directory>
```

## Supported Project Types

### Software Development
- APIs, databases, microservices
- Performance and security requirements
- Integration patterns and best practices

### Construction Projects
- Structural and safety requirements
- Building codes and compliance
- Quality control and inspection criteria

### Manufacturing
- Production processes and equipment
- Quality control and efficiency metrics
- Safety and maintenance requirements

### Business Processes
- Workflow automation and approvals
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Performance metrics and reporting

## Quality Assurance

### EARS Notation Compliance
- **WHEN**: Temporal triggers (user actions, system events)
- **WHERE**: Contextual conditions (states, locations, modes)
- **IF/THEN**: Conditional logic branches
- **WHILE**: Continuous/ongoing behaviors
- **THE [component] SHALL**: Mandatory, testable behavior

### Traceability Requirements
- Every acceptance criterion numbered (N.M format)
- Each design component references specific criteria
- Every task traces back to acceptance criteria
- Complete coverage matrix verification

### Quality Metrics
- All requirements are testable with specific metrics
- Component names consistent across documents
- File paths specified for all implementation tasks
- Error scenarios addressed for each requirement

## Installation

1. **Package the Skill**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/package_skill.py .
   ```

2. **Install in Claude Code**:
   - Copy the generated `.zip` file to your Claude skills directory
   - Follow Claude Code installation instructions

## Usage Examples

### Software Development Example
```
Generate specification documents for a user authentication system with
social login, password reset, and multi-factor authentication capabilities.
```

### Construction Project Example
```
Create specifications for a 3-story commercial office building including
structural requirements, safety compliance, and environmental considerations.
```

### Manufacturing Example
```
Develop specifications for an automated assembly line that produces
electronic components with quality control and safety systems.
```

## Best Practices

### Requirements Generation
- Start with clear business context and user roles
- Include specific performance metrics (response times, throughput)
- Address error conditions and fallback behaviors
- Define acceptance criteria that are measurable and testable

### Design Documentation
- Create clear component boundaries and responsibilities
- Include integration points and data flow
- Document technical decisions with rationale
- Map each design element to specific requirements

### Task Decomposition
- Break complex work into 1-4 hour tasks
- Specify exact file paths and method names
- Include all acceptance criteria references
- Order tasks logically (models → services → APIs → tests)

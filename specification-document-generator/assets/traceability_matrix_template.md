# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Overview

This document provides complete traceability from requirements through design components to implementation tasks and data flows. The matrix ensures that all requirements are fully addressed by the system architecture, implementation plan, and data flow specifications with 100% coverage validation.

## Requirements Coverage Summary

| Requirement | Acceptance Criteria | Design Components | Implementation Tasks | Data Flow Components | Coverage Status |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| [Req #] | [AC Count] | [Component Count] | [Task Count] | [Flow Count] | ✅ Complete |
| [Req #] | [AC Count] | [Component Count] | [Task Count] | [Flow Count] | ✅ Complete |

**Total Requirements**: [Number]
**Total Acceptance Criteria**: [Number]
**Total Design Components**: [Number]
**Total Implementation Tasks**: [Number]
**Total Data Flow Components**: [Number]
**Coverage Percentage**: 100%

## Uncovered Items

### Missing Design Coverage
- [Criterion X.Y]: Not referenced in design document
- [Criterion A.B]: Not referenced in design document

### Missing Task Coverage
- [Criterion C.D]: Not referenced in tasks document
- [Criterion E.F]: Not referenced in tasks document

### Orphaned References
- Design components without requirement references:
  - [Component]: Remove or add requirement references
- Tasks without requirement references:
  - [Task X]: Add _Requirements: field

## Quality Assessment

### Completeness
- ✅ All requirements have acceptance criteria
- ✅ All acceptance criteria are numbered correctly
- ✅ All criteria are testable and measurable
- ⚠️ [Any completeness issues identified]

### Consistency
- ✅ Component names consistent across documents
- ✅ File paths consistent between design and tasks
- ✅ Reference format consistent (N.M)
- ⚠️ [Any consistency issues identified]

### Traceability
- ✅ Complete forward traceability (requirements → design → tasks)
- ✅ Complete backward traceability (tasks → design → requirements)
- ✅ No orphaned elements
- ⚠️ [Any traceability issues identified]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [Fix any missing coverage issues]
2. [Resolve orphaned references]
3. [Standardize terminology]

### Process Improvements
1. [Update verification checklist]
2. [Add additional validation scripts]
3. [Improve documentation templates]

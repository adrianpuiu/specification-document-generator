## Uncovered Items

### Missing Design Coverage
- [Criterion X.Y]: Not referenced in design document
- [Criterion A.B]: Not referenced in design document

### Missing Task Coverage
- [Criterion C.D]: Not referenced in tasks document
- [Criterion E.F]: Not referenced in tasks document

### Orphaned References
- Design components without requirement references:
  - [Component]: Remove or add requirement references
- Tasks without requirement references:
  - [Task X]: Add _Requirements: field

## Quality Assessment

### Completeness
- ✅ All requirements have acceptance criteria
- ✅ All acceptance criteria are numbered correctly
- ✅ All criteria are testable and measurable
- ⚠️ [Any completeness issues identified]

### Consistency
- ✅ Component names consistent across documents
- ✅ File paths consistent between design and tasks
- ✅ Reference format consistent (N.M)
- ⚠️ [Any consistency issues identified]

### Traceability
- ✅ Complete forward traceability (requirements → design → tasks)
- ✅ Complete backward traceability (tasks → design → requirements)
- ✅ No orphaned elements
- ⚠️ [Any traceability issues identified]

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. [Fix any missing coverage issues]
2. [Resolve orphaned references]
3. [Standardize terminology]

### Process Improvements
1. [Update verification checklist]
2. [Add additional validation scripts]
3. [Improve documentation templates]

## Automated Validation Commands

### Numbering and Traceability
```bash
# Check numbering consistency
python scripts/numbering_checker.py <project_directory>

# Validate traceability
python scripts/traceability_validator.py <project_directory>

# Generate coverage report
python scripts/coverage_analyzer.py <project_directory>
```

### Quality Checks
```bash
# Search for common issues
grep -n "SHOULD\|MUST" requirements.md  # Check for non-compliant language
grep -n "system.*shall" requirements.md  # Check for unspecified components
grep -n "_Requirements:" tasks.md        # Verify task traceability format
```

## Common Issues to Check

### Requirements Issues

- Missing component specification ("the system shall")
- Non-measurable criteria ("fast response", "good performance")
- Incomplete error handling scenarios
- Missing performance metrics

### Design Issues
- Components without clear responsibilities
- Missing error handling strategies
- Inadequate consideration of scalability
- Unclear data flow between components

### Tasks Issues
- Tasks without requirement references
- Vague task descriptions
- Missing file paths
- Tasks that are too large or too small
- Incorrect dependency ordering

### Traceability Issues
- Acceptance criteria not referenced in design
- Design elements without implementing tasks

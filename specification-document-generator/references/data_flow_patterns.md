# Data Flow Patterns Guide

## Overview

This guide provides comprehensive data flow patterns and best practices for creating detailed data flow specifications. It includes visual diagram patterns, processing pipeline templates, caching strategies, and error handling approaches for various system types.

## Data Flow Architecture Patterns

### 1. Event-Driven Architecture Pattern
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Event Producers"
        PRODUCER1[Data Source 1]
        PRODUCER2[Data Source 2]
        PRODUCER3[User Actions]
    end

    subgraph "Event Bus"
        EVENTBUS[Message Queue/Event Bus]
    end

    subgraph "Event Consumers"
        PROCESSOR1[Real-time Processor]
        PROCESSOR2[Batch Processor]
        PROCESSOR3[Analytics Engine]
    end

    subgraph "Data Stores"
        REALTIME[Real-time Store]
        ANALYTICAL[Analytics Store]
        ARCHIVE[Cold Storage]
    end

    PRODUCER1 --> EVENTBUS
    PRODUCER2 --> EVENTBUS
    PRODUCER3 --> EVENTBUS

    EVENTBUS --> PROCESSOR1
    EVENTBUS --> PROCESSOR2
    EVENTBUS --> PROCESSOR3

    PROCESSOR1 --> REALTIME
    PROCESSOR2 --> ANALYTICAL
    PROCESSOR3 --> ANALYTICAL
    ANALYTICAL --> ARCHIVE
```

**When to Use**: Real-time systems, high-throughput data processing, microservices architectures
**Key Characteristics**: Asynchronous processing, loose coupling, scalability
**Performance Considerations**: Message queue sizing, consumer scaling, backpressure handling

### 2. Pipeline Architecture Pattern
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Stage 1"
        INGESTION[Data Ingestion]
        VALIDATION[Validation]
    end

    subgraph "Stage 2"
        TRANSFORM[Transformation]
        ENRICH[Enrichment]
    end

    subgraph "Stage 3"
        PROCESSING[Business Logic]
        AGGREGATION[Aggregation]
    end

    subgraph "Stage 4"
        STORAGE[Storage]
        DISTRIBUTION[Distribution]
    end

    INGESTION --> VALIDATION
    VALIDATION --> TRANSFORM
    TRANSFORM --> ENRICH
    ENRICH --> PROCESSING
    PROCESSING --> AGGREGATION
    AGGREGATION --> STORAGE
    STORAGE --> DISTRIBUTION
```

**When to Use**: ETL processes, data processing workflows, analytics pipelines
**Key Characteristics**: Sequential processing, stage-specific optimization, error handling per stage
**Performance Considerations**: Stage throughput balancing, parallel processing opportunities

### 3. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Write Side"
        COMMAND[Command Handler]
        WRITE_DB[Write Database]
        EVENTS[Event Store]
    end

    subgraph "Read Side"
        QUERY[Query Handler]
        READ_DB[Read Database]
        PROJECTION[Projection Engine]
    end

    subgraph "Data Sync"
        SYNC[Event Synchronization]
    end

    COMMAND --> WRITE_DB
    COMMAND --> EVENTS
    EVENTS --> SYNC
    SYNC --> PROJECTION
    PROJECTION --> READ_DB
    QUERY --> READ_DB
```

**When to Use**: High-performance read/write systems, complex business logic, scalability requirements
**Key Characteristics**: Separate read/write models, eventual consistency, optimized data structures
**Performance Considerations**: Read model optimization, synchronization lag handling
